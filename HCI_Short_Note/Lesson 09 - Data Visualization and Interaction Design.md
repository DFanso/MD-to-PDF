# Lesson 09 - Data Visualization and Interaction Design

1. Introduction to Visualization
   - Visualization is a mental process of transforming information into a visual form
   - Enables users to observe information and perceive hidden features needed for data analysis and exploration
   - Scope of visualization is diverse and intersects with various areas of computer science research and development

2. Applications of Visualization
   - Laser-guided surgery, entertainment, teaching, design & modeling
   - Visualization offers a method for seeing the unseen and fostering profound insights

3. The Birth of Information Visualization (InfoVis)
   - Use of computer-supported interactive visual representation of abstract data to amplify cognition
   - Compact graphical presentation of large datasets enabling users to make discoveries, decisions, and explanations
   - Relates to patterns, groups, and individual items

4. Historical Examples of InfoVis
   - Minard's Map (1812-1813): Depicts Napoleon's Russian campaign, conveying multiple variables in a limited space
   - The Tube Map (1932-present): Evolution of the London Underground map, prioritizing clarity over geographical accuracy
   - Dr. John Snow's Map (1854): Plotted locations of cholera deaths, leading to the identification of the Broad Street Pump as the source

5. Shneiderman's Mantra for InfoVis Design
   - Overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand
   - Informal design code for creating effective visualizations
   - Additional considerations: relate, history, extract

6. Data Types in InfoVis
   - Qualitative: nominal (no natural order) and ordinal (natural order)
   - Quantitative: discrete (integers) and continuous (floats, singles, doubles)
   - Examples: 1D linear, 2D map, 3D world, multi-dimensional, temporal, tree, network
   - Different data types require different considerations when representing

7. Examples and Resources
   - GapMinder by Hans Rosling: Interactive visualization of global development data
   - Browsing HCIL (Human-Computer Interaction Lab) for various visualization projects
   - Browsing Visual Complexity for a wide range of complex data visualizations
   - Browsing Data to Viz for a comprehensive guide on creating meaningful visualizations
