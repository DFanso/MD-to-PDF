# Lesson 08 - Usability Heuristics

1. The Practice of Interaction Design
   - Agile development: short iterative development cycles with early and repeated customer/user feedback
   - Design Patterns: capture design experience as solutions to problems in context
   - Open Source Resources: community-driven components, frameworks, and systems available for free
   - Tools for Interaction Design: support creativity, sketching, simulation, brainstorming, library search, mind mapping, video capture, and prototyping

2. Agile UX
   - Integrates interaction design and agile methods, balancing research and reflection with rapid iterations
   - Requires careful planning of when and how much to use UX techniques
   - Focus on product as deliverable, cross-functional teams
   - Three practical areas: user research, aligning work practices, and documentation

3. User Research in Agile UX
   - Characterizes users, tasks, and context through data gathering and analysis
   - Detailed research may not fit within a limited time box; can be performed in iteration 0 or as an ongoing program

4. Aligning Work Practices in Agile UX
   - Parallel tracks approach: create product vision before development, design work one iteration ahead of development
   - Advantages: no wasted design time, timely feedback, flexibility to handle problems

5. Documentation in Agile UX
   - Agile encourages minimal documentation; use only where needed
   - Consider time spent, users, minimum customer needs, sign-off process efficiency, duplication, and required polish

6. Practical Issues in Interaction Design
   - Identifying users/stakeholders: consider distinct user types and stakeholder groups
   - Determining users' needs: explore problem space, investigate users and activities, try ideas, focus on goals
   - Generating alternatives: research, synthesis, cross-fertilization, user input, product evolution, inspiration, balancing constraints
   - Choosing among alternatives: technical feasibility, user/peer evaluation, A/B testing, quality thresholds
   - Integrating interaction design with other models: careful planning, promising integration with agile development

7. Discovering Requirements
   - Purpose: explore problem space, establish description of what will be developed
   - Capturing requirements: prototypes, operational product, structured or rigorous notations
   - Importance: miscommunication occurs most commonly during requirements activity

8. Different Types of Requirements
   - Functional, data, environment or context of use (physical, social, organizational, technical), user (characteristics, usability goals, user experience goals)
   - Usable security: balancing robust security with user experience to prevent circumvention

9. Data Gathering for Requirements
   - Interviews, observation, questionnaires, studying documentation, researching similar products
   - Combining methods is highly productive (e.g., direct/indirect observation, interviews, diaries, surveys)
   - Probes engage users: cultural, design, technology, provocative
   - Contextual Inquiry: one-on-one field interviews guided by "cool concepts" and contextual design models
   - Brainstorming for innovation: diverse participants, catalysts, capturing ideas, sharpening focus, fun

10. Bringing Requirements to Life
    - Personas: rich descriptions of typical users synthesized from research, relevant to product, aid design decisions
    - Scenarios: informal narrative stories, simple, personal, not generalizable, may be textual, animated, audio, or video
    - Personas and scenarios together augment basic requirements and bring them to life
