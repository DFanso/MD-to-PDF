# Lesson 01 - Introduction to Interaction Design

1. Introduction to Interaction Design (IxD)
   - Defines structure and behavior of interactive systems
   - Aims to create meaningful relationships between people and products/services
   - Involves designing interactive products to support communication and interaction
   - Good examples: smartphones, iPads, navigation systems
   - Bad examples: SharePoint, self-checkouts, poorly designed lift controls
   - Considers users, activities, context, and optimizes interactions

2. Transdisciplinary Nature of IxD
   - Involves psychology, social sciences, computing, engineering, and design fields
   - Practiced within HCI, ubiquitous computing, cognitive engineering, information systems, etc.
   - Multidisciplinary teams enable more ideas but present communication challenges

3. User Experience (UX)
   - Encompasses product behavior, usage, and users' feelings, pleasure, and satisfaction
   - Cannot be designed directly, only designed for
   - Affected by pragmatic (simplicity) and hedonic (stimulation) qualities

4. Key Principles of IxD
   - Involve users throughout development
   - Identify clear usability and UX goals upfront
   - Use iteration: discovering requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, evaluating
   - Consider accessibility and inclusivity for widest range of users

5. Usability and UX Goals
   - Usability: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, memorability
   - UX: desirable aspects (fun, entertainment, helpfulness, motivation) vs. undesirable aspects (boredom, frustration, annoyance, cuteness)
   - Potential tradeoffs between usability and UX goals

6. Design Principles
   - Visibility, feedback, constraints, logical mapping, consistency, affordances
   - Act as guiding heuristics for analyzing and evaluating interactive products

7. User-Centered Design
   - Early focus on users and tasks
   - Empirical measurement
   - Iterative design
   - Four basic activities: discovering requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, evaluating
