# Lesson 06 - Interfaces and Interaction

1. 20 Interface Types Covered
   - Command, Graphical, Multimedia, Virtual Reality, Web, Mobile, Appliance, Voice, Pen, Touch, Gesture, Haptic, Multimodal, Shareable, Tangible, Augmented Reality, Wearables, Robots and Drones, Brain-Computer Interaction, Smart

2. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
   - Originated from Xerox Star's WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing Device)
   - Windows: scrollable, stretchable, overlapping, movable screen sections
   - Icons: pictograms representing applications, objects, commands, and tools
   - Menus: lists of options that can be scrolled and selected
   - Pointing Device: mouse controlling the cursor for interacting with GUI elements

3. Window Design
   - Overcome physical constraints of computer displays
   - Enable viewing more information and performing tasks
   - Multiple windows can make finding the desired one difficult
   - Techniques like listing, tabbing, and thumbnails can help

4. Menu Styles
   - Flat list, drop-down, pop-up, contextual, collapsible, mega
   - Each style has its own advantages and use cases

5. Icon Design
   - Assumed to be easier to learn and remember than commands
   - Can be compact and variably positioned on the screen
   - Mapping between representation and referent can be similar, analogical, or arbitrary
   - Most effective icons are similar ones

6. Multimedia
   - Combines graphics, text, video, sound, and animation with interactivity
   - Users click links to navigate, play animations or videos
   - Provides better ways of presenting information when done carefully and consistently

7. Virtual Reality
   - Computer-generated graphical simulations providing an illusion of participation
   - Enables interacting with objects and navigating in 3D space
   - Creates highly engaging user experiences
   - Applications in video games, therapy, travel planning, architecture, design, education

8. Website Design
   - Early websites were text-based with hyperlinks, focusing on information structure
   - Modern websites emphasize distinctive, striking, and aesthetically pleasing designs
   - Need to consider designing for multiple platforms (keyboard vs. touch)
   - Balancing usability and aesthetics is crucial

9. Mobile Interfaces
   - Handheld devices used while on the move (phones, fitness trackers, smartwatches)
   - Larger-sized tablets used in mobile settings by professionals
   - Key concern is the hit area (space for fingers to press accurately)
   - Fitts' law can help design the right spacing

10. Appliances
    - Everyday devices in home, public places, or car (washing machines, remotes, toasters)
    - Personal devices like digital clocks and cameras
    - Used for short periods, need to be usable with minimal learning
    - Design as transient interfaces with short interactions, consider soft vs. hard controls

11. Voice User Interfaces
    - Person talking with a spoken language app (timetable, travel planner, phone service)
    - Used for inquiring about specific information or performing transactions
    - Also used by people with visual impairments
    - Design challenges: keeping conversation on track, efficient navigation, error recovery

12. Pen-based Devices
    - Enable writing, drawing, selecting, and moving objects using light pens or styluses
    - Capitalize on well-honed drawing skills developed from childhood
    - Digital ink (e.g., Anoto) combines ordinary ink pen with digital camera for recording

13. Touchscreens
    - Single touchscreens detect presence and location of a person's touch (kiosks, ATMs)
    - Multi-touch surfaces support dynamic finger actions (swiping, flicking, pinching)
    - Used in smartphones, tablets, tabletops, supporting one and two-hand gestures
    - Design concerns: display size, orientation, shape, and their effect on collaboration

14. Gesture-based Systems
    - Involve moving arms and hands to communicate, using camera recognition and sensors
    - Gestures need to be presented sequentially to be understood

15. Haptic Interfaces
    - Provide tactile feedback by applying vibration and forces to a person's body
    - Vibrotactile feedback can simulate the sense of touch between remote people
    - Design considerations: actuator placement, intensity, context, and creative applications

16. Multimodal Interfaces
    - Combine multiple input modes (e.g., facial recognition, gestures, voice recognition)
    - Example: Kinect camera detects multimodal input in real-time to build a person's model

17. Shareable Interfaces
    - Designed for more than one person to use, providing multiple inputs
    - Examples: large wall displays with pens or gestures, interactive tabletops with fingertips

18. Tangible Interfaces
    - Physical objects coupled with digital representations, manipulating objects causes digital effects
    - Example: VoxBox, a tangible system for gathering opinions at events

19. Augmented Reality
    - Virtual representations superimposed on physical devices and objects
    - Examples: Pok√©mon Go (using smartphone camera and GPS), medical applications

20. Wearables
    - Devices worn on the body (jewelry, glasses, fabrics) to interact with digital information
    - Applications: automatic diaries, tour guides, cycle indicators, fashion clothing

21. Brain-Computer Interfaces
    - Allow direct communication between the brain and an external device
    - Example: a woman who is paralyzed using BCI to select letters on a screen

22. Robots
    - Main types: remote robots (hazardous settings), domestic robots (household chores), pet robots (companions), sociable robots (collaborating with humans)

23. Drones
    - Unmanned aircraft controlled remotely, used in entertainment, agriculture, wildlife protection
    - Can fly low and stream photos to ground stations for mapping and analysis

24. Smart Interfaces
    - Devices connected to the internet and other devices, having some intelligence
    - Context-aware: understand surroundings and execute appropriate actions (e.g., Nest thermostat)
    - Human-building interaction: buildings designed to sense and act on behalf of inhabitants
