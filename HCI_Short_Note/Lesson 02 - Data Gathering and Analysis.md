# Lesson 02 - Data Gathering and Analysis

1. Topics Covered in Lecture 2
   - What data needs to be gathered
   - Planning and running a successful data gathering program
   - Conducting interviews, designing questionnaires, and planning observations
   - Analyzing qualitative and quantitative data, and presenting findings
   - Software packages for data analysis

2. Key Issues in Data Gathering
   - Setting goals and deciding how to analyze data
   - Identifying participants and determining sample size
   - Maintaining clear and professional relationships with participants
   - Obtaining informed consent when appropriate
   - Triangulation: collecting data from multiple perspectives and sources
   - Conducting pilot studies

3. Data Recording Methods
   - Notes, audio, video, and photographs (individually or combined)
   - Each method has different challenges and advantages

4. Interviews
   - Unstructured, structured, or semi-structured (recommended)
   - Focus groups: group interviews that generate discussion and debate
   - Avoid long, compound, jargon-filled, leading, or biased questions
   - Follow a logical structure: introduction, warm-up, main body, cool-off, closure
   - Can be conducted using digital conferencing systems (e.g., Skype, Zoom)

5. Questionnaires
   - Closed questions (easier to analyze) vs. open questions
   - Administered to large populations via paper, email, or web
   - Design considerations: question order, clear instructions, balanced layout, question length
   - Response formats: checkboxes, rating scales (Likert and semantic), open-ended responses
   - Encourage good response rates through clear purpose, anonymity, incentives, and follow-up

6. Online Questionnaires
   - Advantages: quick distribution and response, cost-effective, easy data collection and analysis
   - Challenges: unknown population size, preventing multiple responses, question alteration
   - Deployment steps: plan timeline, design offline, program online, test, and recruit participants

7. Observation Methods
   - Direct observation in the field or controlled environments
   - Indirect observation: diaries, interaction logging, video/photo remote collection
   - Structuring frameworks to guide observation (e.g., person, place, thing; Robson's framework)
   - Planning considerations: level of involvement, acceptance, sensitive topics, data collection

8. Data Analysis
   - Quantitative data (numbers) vs. qualitative data (themes, patterns, stories)
   - Basic quantitative analysis: averages (mean, median, mode), percentages, graphical representations
   - Question design affects analysis: open (analyzed separately) vs. closed (analyzed quantitatively)
   - Basic qualitative analysis: critical incidents, identifying themes (inductive), categorizing data (deductive)
   - Interaction analysis: understanding interactions between people and artifacts using empirical observations
   - Tools: spreadsheets, statistical packages (SAS, SPSS), qualitative data analysis tools (NVivo, Dedoose)

9. Interpreting and Presenting Findings
   - Use visualizations (e.g., bubble diagrams, timelines) to communicate insights effectively
   - Employ structured notations and stories to present different viewpoints and summarize findings
