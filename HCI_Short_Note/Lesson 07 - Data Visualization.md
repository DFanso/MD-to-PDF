# Lesson 07 - Data Visualization

1. What is a Prototype?
   - One manifestation of a design that allows stakeholders to interact with it
   - In interaction design, prototypes can be screen sketches, storyboards, PowerPoint slides, videos, physical objects, cardboard mock-ups, or limited functionality software

2. Why Prototype?
   - Evaluation and feedback are central to interaction design
   - Stakeholders can see, hold, and interact with a prototype more easily than a document or drawing
   - Team members can communicate effectively, ideas can be tested out, and prototyping encourages reflection
   - Prototypes answer questions and support designers in choosing between alternatives

3. Low-fidelity Prototyping
   - Uses a medium unlike the final medium (e.g., paper, cardboard)
   - Quick, cheap, and easily changed
   - Examples: 'Post-it' notes, storyboards, sketches of screens and task sequences, 'Wizard-of-Oz'

4. Storyboards
   - A series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a task using the product
   - Often used with scenarios, bringing in more detail and a chance to role-play

5. Sketching
   - Low-fidelity prototyping often relies on sketching
   - Don't be inhibited about drawing ability; practice simple symbols

6. 'Wizard-of-Oz' Prototyping
   - The user thinks they are interacting with a computer, but a human is responding to output rather than the system
   - Usually done early in design to understand users' expectations
   - Requires a script, a participant to play the role of the end user, and a human "wizard" simulating the completed product's behavior

7. High-fidelity Prototyping
   - Uses materials expected in the final product; looks more like the final system than a low-fidelity version
   - Can be developed by integrating existing hardware and software components
   - Danger that users think they have a complete system

8. Compromises in Prototyping
   - Prototyping involves compromises (e.g., slow response, sketchy icons, limited functionality)
   - Two common types of compromise: horizontal (wide range of functions, little detail) and vertical (a lot of detail for only a few functions)
   - Compromises in prototypes must not be ignored

9. Conceptual Design
   - A conceptual model outlines what people can do with a product and what concepts are needed to understand and interact with it
   - Understand problem space, current requirements, and empathize with users
   - Use creativity and brainstorming techniques (e.g., mood board)
   - Consider alternatives using scenarios and prototyping

10. Concrete Design
    - Emphasis differs from conceptual design
    - Aspects include color, icons, buttons, interaction devices, user characteristics, context, inclusiveness, accessibility, cross-cultural design, and indigenous knowledge

11. Generating Prototypes
    - Break down scenarios into steps and create a scene for each step to generate a storyboard
    - Sketching out a storyboard prompts designers to think about design issues
    - Generate a card-based prototype from a storyboard or use case by considering each step and drawing a card that captures the interaction element

12. Explore the User's Experience
    - Use card-based prototypes to model the user experience
    - Visual representations called customer or user journey maps, or experience maps
    - Common representations: wheel and timeline

13. Construction: Physical Computing
    - Build and code prototypes using electronics with toolkits like Arduino, LilyPad, Senseboard, BBC micro:bit, and MaKey MaKey
    - Designed for use by a wide range of people

14. Construction: Software Development Kits (SDKs)
    - Programming tools and components to develop for a specific platform (e.g., iOS)
    - Includes IDE, documentation, drivers, sample code, and APIs
    - Makes development much easier
    - Examples: Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit, Apple's ARKit, Microsoft's Kinect SDK
