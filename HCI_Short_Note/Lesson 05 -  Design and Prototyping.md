# Lesson 05 - Design and Prototyping

1. Visibility of System Status
   - Designs should keep users informed about what is going on through appropriate, timely feedback.
   - Example: Interactive mall maps show people their current location to help them navigate.

2. Match Between System and the Real World
   - The design should use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.
   - Example: Stovetop controls are mapped to the corresponding heating elements for easy understanding.

3. User Control and Freedom
   - Users often perform actions by mistake and need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action.
   - Example: Digital spaces, like physical spaces, need quick "emergency" exits.

4. Consistency and Standards
   - Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
   - Example: Check-in counters are usually located at the front of hotels, meeting user expectations.

5. Error Prevention
   - Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
   - Example: Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs.

6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
   - Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. Avoid making users remember information.
   - Example: People are likely to correctly answer "Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal?" based on recognition rather than recall.

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
   - Shortcuts, hidden from novice users, may speed up the interaction for expert users.
   - Example: Regular routes are listed on maps, but locals with more area knowledge can take shortcuts.

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
   - Interfaces should not contain irrelevant information. Every extra unit of information competes with the relevant units.
   - Example: A minimalist three-legged stool still serves its purpose as a place to sit.

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
   - Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
   - Example: Wrong-way signs on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction.

10. Help and Documentation
    - It's best if the design doesn't need additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users complete their tasks.
    - Example: Information kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers' problems in context and immediately.
