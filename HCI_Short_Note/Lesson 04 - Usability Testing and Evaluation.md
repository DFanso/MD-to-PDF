# Lesson 04 - Usability Testing and Evaluation

1. Prepare Your Test Plan
   - Include test plan name, scenario name, goals, quantitative and qualitative measurements, scenario, task list, post-scenario interview or questionnaire questions, and test setup details
   - Different roles have different tasks (e.g., admin, users)

2. General Procedure for Usability Test Sessions
   - Prepare test room, greet the guest, conduct pre-test questions, explain interface, present the scenario, administer post-scenario questionnaire or interview, repeat steps for each scenario, conduct post-test questionnaire, thank the participant, and organize files

3. What, Why, and When to Evaluate
   - What: Evaluate various features, some in the lab and others in natural settings
   - Why: Ensure users can use the product and like it
   - When: During design (formative evaluation) or after the design is finished (summative evaluation)

4. Persona, User Story, Scenario, and Storyboard
   - User research is the first step in designing around users
   - Persona: Archetype or character representing a potential user
   - User story: Short statement identifying the user and their need/goal
   - Scenario: Situation capturing how users perform tasks on the site or app
   - Storyboard: Visual representation of how the user would interact with the site or app

5. Example of a Scenario
   - Mary, mother of 16-year-old Amy, wants her daughter to learn about her culture
   - Amy finds cultural heritage sites uninteresting
   - Mary finds a mobile app that enables visitors to experience life back in time
   - Amy uses smart eyeglasses with the app to immerse herself in the historical atmosphere
   - The experience changes Amy's perspective and appreciation for history and her culture

6. Characteristics of a Perfect User Scenario
   - Short story clearly defining the context of product use
   - Answers questions about the user, their goals, how they achieve them, and why they choose the product
   - Keeps scenarios close to reality using typical user expressions and wording

7. Examples of Prototyping and Field Studies
   - Prototyping example: Smart Ambient, a pilot study to contextualize mobile learning in the domain of cultural heritage
   - Field study example: Design challenges for mobile and wearable systems to support learning on the move at outdoor cultural heritage sites

8. Examples of User Testing Using Paper-Based Prototypes
   - Several YouTube video examples demonstrating user testing with paper-based prototypes
